## 🚴‍♀️ Introduction

People who commute by bicycle are abbreviated as "자출족." What is the first step toward becoming "자출족"? Rather than buying expensive bikes, you should first check how much roads dedicated to bicycles are available and where is the safest route through a map. In particular, prior exploration is essential. Our app helps users choose a safer commute route by sharing their experiences.
